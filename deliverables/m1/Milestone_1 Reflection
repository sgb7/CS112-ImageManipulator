  # Milestone 1 Reflection

	This project wasn’t too difficult actually! I began by refactoring my old code, because it definitely needed it. 
  That probably gave me the most trouble out of everything, though it was a manageable sort of trouble. After that the rest 
  was easy. There was one small hitch when the code wouldn’t run on my laptop—for a reason I’m still not sure about—but when 
  I later tried it on one of the school’s computers it worked fine, so I didn’t end up having to change anything. I’ll have 
  to look into why it wasn’t running on my laptop later, though, since I do enjoy not having to make a trek to the library or 
  a computer lab just to do my homework.
	The most fun part of the assignment for me was applying the different effects to the photo, for a few reasons. For starters,
  it wasn’t too tricky to accomplish, once I’d figured out the math I needed to use. Figuring out how to apply grayscale took 
  the most thought, out of everything. It was also neat to see how ppm files work and all the different ways you can effect 
  them, and very satisfying to be the one creating those effects in the first place. I’ve applied effects to photos through 
  apps and stuff, and even getting just an inkling of how those apps work—I’m sure it’s more complicated than messing with the 
  ppm file, but still—was really cool. 
	My coding skills have for sure improved a lot at this point. It’s getting easier to come up with different ways to 
  accomplish what I want to with code, and when I do come across unexpected challenges it doesn’t feel like the end of the 
  world. There’s room for improvement, of course, but that’s hardly a bad thing. It just means I’ve got more to learn, and 
  I’m looking forward to it.
