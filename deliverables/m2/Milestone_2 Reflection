Milestone 2 Reflection

      This project was fairly easy I think. I had to review a couple things, but once I’d done that I was able to accomplish what 
  I needed without too much trouble. The biggest hitch was probably figuring out how to randomly select numbers. I checked out 
  a few different options online, and then tried implementing them. It took a few tries to get it working the way I wanted but 
  I eventually managed to make it run. There was also another issue, where it suddenly wasn’t reading the file, and I was 
  getting frustrated because I couldn’t figure out why. Then I realized: the image I was trying to access wasn’t in my project 
  folder. Lo and behold once I took care of that, it worked fine, so if I had to pick something I learned from this, it’s to 
  remember to check all the little things before scrutinizing your code. The fact that that small thing was the issue all along
  is even a little funny, looking back on it.
	    The thing I enjoyed most about this project was adding more effects, same as the last one. It’s just really cool to see all 
  the different things you can do to the photo just by messing around with the numbers. And making it so I can now add 
  multiple effects was a fun addition. It made the whole thing feel even more realistic, like the photo apps people download 
  and use on their phones. I’m looking forward to the next project, even though I can tell it’s going to be a little more 
  challenging than these last two. I’m definitely going to try and start earlier on it than I did with this project and the 
  last, since I want plenty of time to work through any issues I come across. 
	    So yeah, fun project. As always, it’s very satisfying to see something I worked on run successfully.
