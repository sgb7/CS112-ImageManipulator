  Milestone 3 Reflection

	  So, this project was definitely a challenge, and, try as I might have, I was not able to get everything up and running in 
  time. I did manage to get the horizontal and vertical flips working just fine, so I’d say those were the easiest out of 
  everything. The hardest would have to be the 90 degree rotation, because I wasn’t entirely sure where to start with that. 
	  I thought I had pixelate and blur handled—-pixelate more than blur—-but then blur kept throwing me errors, and pixelate would sort 
  of stall? It might have something to do with memory, maybe, since that makes sense in terms of slowing the whole thing down, 
  but I’m not a hundred percent sure either way. I’ll have to crack down on it later and see what’s going on, maybe revise 
  some of my older code while I’m at it to make everything as a whole run more smoothly. 
	  The most fun thing about this whole project was probably implementing a 2D vector. Not because it was easy or anything—-I 
  actually had some trouble with that too, in the beginning, but I worked it out in the end-—but because it’s sort of cool. I 
  feel like there’s a lot of possible applications for it, and thinking about everything in the context of a 2D structure was 
  interesting. 
	  So yeah. I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t finish it in time, but it is what it is. The whole thing was still a good 
  learning experience, and it’ll be cool when I finally do get everything running properly.
